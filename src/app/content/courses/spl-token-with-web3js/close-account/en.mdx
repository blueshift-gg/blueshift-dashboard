# Close Account Instruction

Closes a token account and transfers its remaining SOL rent to a destination account. The token account must have zero balance unless it's a native SOL account.

> From Token2022 it's possible to close a `Mint` account that has a supply of 0

Before we can close any token account, we'll need to already have:
- Initialized a `Mint` account
- Initialized a `Token` account or `Associated Token` account that doesn't have any token inside.

<ArticleSection name="Raw Instruction" id="raw-instruction" level="h2" />

By using just "raw" instruction without any abstraction, this is how closing an account would look like:

```ts
// Delegate an ATA 
const closeAccountInstruction = createCloseAccountInstruction(
    tokenAccount // account
    keypair.publickey // destination
    keypair.publickey // authority
);

const transaction = new Transaction().add(closeAccountInstruction);

const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [keypair]);

console.log(`Token accounts closed! Check out your TX here: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${signature}?cluster=devnet`);
```

<ArticleSection name="Abstracted Instruction" id="abstracted-instruction" level="h2" />

This is how the same instructions would look like abstracted away with the `closeAccount()` instruction:

```ts
  let tx = await closeAccount(
    connection,
    keypair,
    ata.address, // token Account
    keypair.publicKey, // destination
    keypair.publicKey, // authority
);

console.log(`Succesfully Closed!. Transaction Here: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${tx}?cluster=devnet`)
```
