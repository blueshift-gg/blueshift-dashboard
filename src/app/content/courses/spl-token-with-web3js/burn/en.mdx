# Burn Instruction

Permanently destroys tokens by removing them from circulation. This reduces the total supply of the token.

Before we can burn any token, we'll need to already have:
- Initialized a `Mint` account.
- A `Token` account or `Associated Token` account that already has at least the amount we want to burn.

> The amount of tokens we burn are "normalized" for decimals. This means that if we want to burn 1 token that has 6 decimals, we'll need to actually put `1e6` as amount

<ArticleSection name="Raw Instruction" id="raw-instruction" level="h2" />

By using just "raw" instruction without any abstraction, this is how burning a token would look like:

```ts
// Burn tokens to ATA 
const burnInstruction = createBurnInstruction(
    tokenAccount, // token account
    mint, // mint
    keypair.publicKey // owner
    1e6, // amount
);

const transaction = new Transaction().add(burnInstruction);

const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [keypair]);

console.log(`Tokens Burned! Check out your TX here: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${signature}?cluster=devnet`);
```

<ArticleSection name="Abstracted Instruction" id="abstracted-instruction" level="h2" />

This is how the same instructions would look like abstracted away with the `burn()` instruction:

```ts  
let tx = await burn(
    connection, // connection
    keypair, // payer
    tokenAccount, // token account
    keypair.publicKey, // owner of the token account
    1e6, // amount to transfer
);

console.log(`Succesfully Burned!. Transaction Here: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${tx}?cluster=devnet`)
```
