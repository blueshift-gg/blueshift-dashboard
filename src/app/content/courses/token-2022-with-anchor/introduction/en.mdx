# The Token2022 Program

The Token2022 Program, also known as Token Extensions, is a superset of the functionality provided by the Token Program. 

If you want to learn more about what additional functionalities are available and what are the differences with the Legacy token program, go follow [this course](/en/courses/token-2022-program)  

> If you're not familiar with anchor, we advise you to go through our [introduction to anchor course](/en/courses/introduction-to-anchor) before moving forward.

For anchor, everything token related can be found in the `anchor-spl` crate. For this reason, after having initialized an `Anchor` workspace we can just do:

```
cargo add anchor-spl
```

> The version of `anchor-spl` needs to be the same of our `anchor-lang` crate. And token2022 extensions are available only from version 0.30.0 forward. 

Don't forget to then update the `idl-build` feature  that can be found into the `[features]` section of the `cargo.toml` file of our program with `idl-build = ["anchor-lang/idl-build", "anchor-spl/idl-build"]`

<ArticleSection name="Mint and Token Accounts" id="mint-and-token-accounts" level="h2" />

If you're familiar with `Anchor`, you'll know that they have a set of macros that help the user abstract away a lot of the complexities related to initializing accounts.

The same works here for `Mint`, `Token` and `Associated Token` accounts.

### Mint Account with Extensions

Since `Mint` account with extensions have different size and are owned by a different program, `Anchor` created a new type of accounts that works independently if the `Mint` account is from the Legacy Token or from the Token2022 program.

To use them, we just need to import both the `TokenInterface` and `Mint` from the `anchor_spl::token_interface` like this: 

```rust
use anchor_spl::token_interface::{TokenInterface, Mint};
```

After that we can just do `pub mint: InterfaceAccount<'info, Mint>,` and specify that we want the mint to use the token_program account that we have in the account struct like this: `mint::token_program = token_program` and we are good! 

> The token interface provides a common way to interact with both types of accounts without needing to handle the differences in their deserialization logic while maintaining type safety and proper validation.

Before diving into how to add extension to the mint account, this is how to create a mint with the Token2022 program:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateMint<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = signer,
        mint::decimals = 6,
        mint::authority = signer.key(),
        mint::token_program = token_program
    )]
    pub mint: InterfaceAccount<'info, Mint>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
    pub token_program: Interface<'info, TokenInterface>,
}
```

Now, luckily, `Anchor` has our back, and created some macros to add the most popular extensions directly in the initialize step like so:

```rust
#[account(
    // ...init
    extensions::metadata_pointer::authority = <target_account>,
    extensions::metadata_pointer::metadata_address = <target_account>,
    extensions::group_pointer::authority = <target_account>,
    extensions::group_pointer::group_address = <target_account>,
    extensions::group_member_pointer::authority = <target_account>,
    extensions::group_member_pointer::member_address = <target_account>,
    extensions::transfer_hook::authority = <target_account>,
    extensions::transfer_hook::program_id = <target_pubkey>
    extensions::close_authority::authority = <target_account>,
    extensions::permanent_delegate::delegate = <target_account>,
)]
pub mint: InterfaceAccount<'info, Mint>,

### Associated Token Account with Extensions

`Associated Token` accounts comes with the `ImmutableOwner` extension by default. So the only difference between the creation of a Legacy or Token2022 `Token Account` is just the usage of the `Interface Account`.

Here's how to create an associated token account:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateAssociatedToken<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,
    pub mint: InterfaceAccount<'info, Mint>,
    #[account(
        mut,
        associated_token::mint = mint,
        associated_token::authority = signer,
        associated_token::token_program = token_program,
    )]
    pub associated_token: InterfaceAccount<'info, TokenAccount>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
    pub token_program: Interface<'info, TokenInterface>,
}
```

### Token Account with Extensions

The `Token` accounts doesn't come with any extension by default and it doesn't have any macro that helps us out. So using macros we can only create a normal Token2022 `Token` account.

Here's how to create a token account:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateToken<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,
    pub mint: InterfaceAccount<'info, Mint>,
    #[account(
        mut,
        token::mint = mint,
        token::authority = signer,
        token::token_program = token_program,
    )]
    pub token: InterfaceAccount<'info, TokenAccount>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
    pub token_program: Interface<'info, TokenInterface>,
}
```
