# Transfer Instruction

Moves tokens from one account to another. This is the basic operation for sending tokens between users.

Before we can transfer any token, we'll need to already have:
- Initialized a `Mint` account.
- A source `Token` account or `Associated Token` account that already has at least the amount we want to transfer.
- A destination `Token` account or `Associated Token` account that will receive the tokens from the source `Token` account.

> The amount of tokens we transfer are "normalized" for decimals. This means that if we want to transfer 1 token that has 6 decimals, we'll need to actually put `1_000_000` as amount

This is how the CPI to the `transfer()` instruction looks like: 

```rust
transfer(
    CpiContext::new(
        ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
        Transfer {
            from: ctx.accounts.from_token_account.to_account_info(),
            to: ctx.accounts.to_token_account.to_account_info(),
            authority: ctx.accounts.authority.to_account_info(),
        },
    ),
    &1_000_000,
)?;
```
