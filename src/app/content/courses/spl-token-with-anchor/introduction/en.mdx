# The Token Program

On Solana everything token related is handled by the [SPL Token Program](https://github.com/solana-program/token) and the [Token2022 Program](/en/courses/token-2022-program): Solana's native token framework that defines how all tokens are created, managed, and transferred.

It's a single, unified program that handles all token operations across the network, ensuring consistency and interoperability.

> The decision of having a single, unified interface for all tokens on Solana creates an easy implementation that can be replicated across all dApps (decentralized applications) and integrations (like wallets, ...)

For anchor, everything token related can be found in the `anchor-spl` crate. For this reason, after having initialized an `Anchor` workspace we can just do:


```
cargo add anchor-spl
```

> If you're not familiar with anchor, we advise you to go through our [introduction to anchor course](/en/courses/introduction-to-anchor) before moving forward.

<ArticleSection name="Mint and Token Accounts" id="mint-and-token-accounts" level="h2" />

If you're familiar with `Anchor`, you'll know that they have a set of macros that help the user abstract away a lot of the complexities related to initializing accounts.

The same works here for `Mint`, `Token` and `Associated Token` accounts.

### Mint Account

Thanks to the macros that `Anchor` offers, this is how we can easily create a `Mint` account:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateMint<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = signer,
        mint::decimals = 6,
        mint::authority = signer.key(),
    )]
    pub mint: Account<'info, Mint>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
    pub token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
}
```

### Token Account

Same goes with the `Token` account. Creating a `Token` accounts through macros would look like this:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateToken<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,
    pub mint: Account<'info, Mint>,
    #[account(
        mut,
        token::mint = mint,
        token::authority = signer,
    )]
    pub token: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
    pub token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
}
```

### Associated Token Account

Same goes for the `Associated Token` account, creating an `Associated Token` accounts through macros would look similar to creating a `Token` account, the only difference are the constraint and this is how it would look like:
```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct CreateToken<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,
    pub mint: Account<'info, Mint>,
    #[account(
        mut,
        associated_token::mint = mint,
        associated_token::authority = signer,
    )]
    pub token: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
    pub token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
    pub associated_token_program: Program<'info, AssociatedToken>,
}
```
