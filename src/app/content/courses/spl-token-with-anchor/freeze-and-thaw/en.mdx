# Freeze and Thaw Instructions

Freeze prevents all token operations on an account until it's thawed. Only the mint's freeze authority can perform this operation.

> Completely disables transfers, approvals, and burns and it only affects the specific frozen account

Thaw re-enables token operations on a previously frozen account. Only the mint's freeze authority can thaw accounts.

> Restores full functionality to a frozen account and can only be performed by the mint's freeze authority

Before we can freeze or thaw any token account, we'll need to already have:
- Initialized a `Mint` account which we hold the `freezeAuthority`
- Initialized a `Token` account or `Associated Token` account that we want to freeze or thaw

This is how the CPI to the `freeze_account()` instruction looks like: 

```rust
freeze_account(
    CpiContext::new(
        ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
        FreezeAccount {
            account: ctx.accounts.token_account.to_account_info(),
            mint: ctx.accounts.mint.to_account_info(),,
            authority: ctx.accounts.authority.to_account_info(),
        },
    ),
)?;
```

And this is how the CPI to the `thaw_account()` instruction looks like: 

```rust
thaw_account(
    CpiContext::new(
        ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
        ThawAccount {
            account: ctx.accounts.token_account.to_account_info(),
            mint: ctx.accounts.mint.to_account_info(),,
            authority: ctx.accounts.authority.to_account_info(),
        },
    ),
)?;
```
