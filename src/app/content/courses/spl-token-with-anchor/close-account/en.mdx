# Close Account Instruction

Closes a token account and transfers its remaining SOL rent to a destination account. The token account must have zero balance unless it's a native SOL account.

> From Token2022 it's possible to close a `Mint` account that has a supply of 0

Before we can close any token account, we'll need to already have:
- Initialized a `Mint` account
- Initialized a `Token` account or `Associated Token` account that doesn't have any token inside.

This is how the CPI to the `close_account()` instruction looks like: 

```rust
close_account(
    CpiContext::new(
        ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
        CloseAccount {
            account: ctx.accounts.token_account.to_account_info(),
            destination: ctx.accounts.authority.to_account_info(),,
            authority: ctx.accounts.authority.to_account_info(),
        },
    ),
)?;
```
