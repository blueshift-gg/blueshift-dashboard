# Burn Instruction

Permanently destroys tokens by removing them from circulation. This reduces the total supply of the token.

Before we can burn any token, we'll need to already have:
- Initialized a `Mint` account.
- A `Token` account or `Associated Token` account that already has at least the amount we want to burn.

> The amount of tokens we burn are "normalized" for decimals. This means that if we want to burn 1 token that has 6 decimals, we'll need to actually put `1_000_000` as amount

This is how the CPI to the `burn()` instruction looks like: 

```rust
burn(
    CpiContext::new(
        ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
        Burn {
            mint: ctx.accounts.mint.to_account_info(),
            from: ctx.accounts.token_account.to_account_info(),
            authority: ctx.accounts.authority.to_account_info(),
        },
    ),
    &1_000_000,
)?;
```
