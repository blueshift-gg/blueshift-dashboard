# Functionalities

The Token Program operates through a set of instructions that allow you to create token mints, initialize token accounts, transfer tokens between accounts, and manage authorities. 

It also supports multisignature accounts for enhanced security and provides mechanisms for freezing accounts and delegating token authority.

<ArticleSection name="Initializing an Account" id="intializing-an-account" level="h2" />

The token program has different instructions and helpers that abstract away the complexities of intializing a new account. 

There are different instructions if we want to initialize a `Mint` account or a `Token` account, in the case of the `Associated Token` account, the associated token program uses the `initializeAccount` instruction under the hood after having derived the correct program derived address.

> This function just initializes the account, so we need to make sure that we use the `createAccount()` instruction from the System Program before, and set the correct owner (token program), space and lamports to make it rent exempt.

<ArticleSection name="Transfer" id="transfer" level="h2" />

Moves tokens from one account to another. This is the basic operation for sending tokens between users.

The owner of the token account needs to be a `Signer` of that transaction, and the destination of that transfer needs to be another token account. 

> The amount that we decide to transfer is without decimals. So if we want to send 1 token that has 6 decimals we'll need to use the `1e6` notation.

<ArticleSection name="Approve" id="approve" level="h2" />

Grants a delegate the authority to transfer a specific amount of tokens on behalf of the account owner. This enables programmatic token transfers without giving full account control.

> We set an "approved" amount, and the delegate can transfer only up to that amount

<ArticleSection name="Revoke" id="revoke" level="h2" />

Removes the current delegate's authority over the account, returning full control to the account owner.

> Immediately cancels any existing delegation and only the account owner can revoke delegation (not the delegate itself)

<ArticleSection name="Set Authority" id="set-authority" level="h2" />

Changes the authority of a mint or account. This allows transferring ownership or updating specific authority types.

> Can change mint authority, freeze authority, or account owner and setting authority to `None` is an irreversible action that permanently removes that capability

<ArticleSection name="Mint To" id="mint-to" level="h2" />

Creates new tokens and deposits them into a specified account. Only the mint authority can perform this operation.

> Increases the total supply of the token and the amount respects the mint's decimal configuration

<ArticleSection name="Burn" id="burn" level="h2" />

Permanently destroys tokens by removing them from circulation. This reduces the total supply of the token.

> Permanently reduces the token's total supply and this action can be performed by the account owner or delegate

<ArticleSection name="Close Account" id="close-account" level="h2" />

Closes a token account and transfers its remaining SOL rent to a destination account. The token account must have zero balance unless it's a native SOL account.

> From Token2022 it's possible to close a `Mint` account that has a supply of 0

<ArticleSection name="Freeze Account" id="set-mint-to" level="h2" />

Prevents all token operations on an account until it's thawed. Only the mint's freeze authority can perform this operation.

> Completely disables transfers, approvals, and burns and it only affects the specific frozen account

<ArticleSection name="Thaw Account" id="thaw-account" level="h2" />

Re-enables token operations on a previously frozen account. Only the mint's freeze authority can thaw accounts.

> Restores full functionality to a frozen account and can only be performed by the mint's freeze authority
