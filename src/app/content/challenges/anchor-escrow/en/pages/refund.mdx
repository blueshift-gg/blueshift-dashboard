We can now move to the `refund` instruction, that lives in the `refund.rs` and will perform these actions:
- Close the escrow PDA and send its rent lamports back to the maker.
- Move the full Token A balance out of the vault and back to the maker, then close the vault account.

### Accounts 

The accounts needed in this context are:
- `maker`: the user that decided the terms of the exchange
- `escrow`: the account where all the terms of this exchange lives
- `mint_a`: the token that the `maker` has deposited
- `vault`: the token account associated with the `escrow` and `mint_a` where the tokens have been deposited
- `maker_ata_a`: the token account associated with the `maker` and `mint_a` that will receive the tokens from the `vault`
- `associated_token_program`: the associated token program used to create the associated token accounts
- `token_program`: the token program used to CPI the transfer
- `system_program`: the system program used to create the `Escrow`

This time we're not going to help you by creating the `Context`, so try doing it yourself! Please make sure to use the right order of accounts or our tests will fail.

### Logic 

The logic is similar to the `take` instruction but this time we just move the tokens from the `vault` to the `maker_ata_a` before closing the now empty vault. 

This time it's your turn to learn how to do it yourself, so we're not going to tell you what the solution is.

Just know that once this executes, the offer is void, the vault is gone, and the maker has their Token A and rent back in their wallet.

Now that we created all the function in the different instruction, we can finally populate the `lib.rs` with all the function we created; like this:

<Codeblock lang="rust">
```rust
#[program]
pub mod blueshift_anchor_escrow {
    use super::*;

    pub fn make(ctx: Context<Make>, seed: u64, receive: u64, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
        instructions::make::handler(ctx, seed, receive, amount)
    }

    pub fn take(ctx: Context<Take>) -> Result<()> {
        instructions::take::handler(ctx)
    }

    pub fn refund(ctx: Context<Refund>) -> Result<()> {
        instructions::refund::handler(ctx)
    }
}
```
</Codeblock>

You can now test your program against our unit tests and claim your NFTs!

Start by building your program using the following command in your terminal

```bash
anchor build
```

This generated a `.so` file directly in your `target/deploy` folder. 

Now click on the `take challenge` button and drop the file there!
