<ChallengeTitle>Pinocchio Escrow</ChallengeTitle>

It's now time to put what you've learned to the test. Using what you've learned from the lesson, build an amm program using the Pinocchio framework that satisfies the following requirements:

<RequirementList>
  <Requirement
    title="Challenge 1: Creating the `Config` account "
    description="Your program should allow an `initializer` to create a `config` account and create a `Mint` account for your LP token. Define an instruction to do this using an instruction discriminator with value `0`."
  />

  <Requirement
    title="Challenge 2: Depositing into the Amm"
    description="Your program should allow a user to deposit into the liquidity pool of an Amm and calculate the amount of LP token that is going to receive for its contribution. Define an instruction to do this using an instruction discriminator value of `1`."
  />

  <Requirement
    title="Challenge 3: Withdrawing into the Amm"
    description="Your program should allow a user to withdraw from the liquidity pool of an Amm and calculate the amount of LP token to burn for it. Define an instruction to do this using an instruction discriminator value of `2`."
  />

  <Requirement
    title="Challenge 4: Swap into the Amm"
    description="Your program should allow a user to swap from the liquidity pool of an Amm. Define an instruction to do this using an instruction discriminator value of `3`."
  />
</RequirementList>
