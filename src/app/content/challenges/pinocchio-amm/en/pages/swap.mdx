# Swap

The `swap` instruction performs two main tasks:
- Calculate the amount of `mint_x` that we're going to receive by sending a certain amount of `mint_y` into the amm (and viceversa) with fee.
- Transfer the `from` token to the vault and the `to` token to the user token account

> As mention in the `initialize` instruction section; we're going to initialize all the `Associated Token Accounts` outside of our instruction for optimization purposes.

<ArticleSection name="Required Accounts" id="required-accounts" level="h2" />

Below are the accounts required for this context:
- `user`: The user that is swapping the token into the liquidity of the Amm. Must be a `signer`.
- `vault_x`: The token account that holds all of token X deposited into the pool. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `vault_y`: The token account that holds all of token Y deposited into the pool. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `user_x_ata`: The user's associated token account for token X. This is the account that will receieve or send token X into the pool. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `user_y_ata`: The user's associated token account for token Y. This is the account that will receieve or send token Y into the pool. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `config`: The configuration account for the AMM pool. Stores all relevant pool parameters and state.
- `token program`: The SPL Token program account. This is required to perform token operations such as transfers and minting. Must be `executable`.

Here, again, I’ll leave the implementation to you:

<Codeblock lang="rust">
```rust
pub struct SwapAccounts<'a> {
    pub user: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub user_x: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub user_y: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub vault_x: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub vault_y: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub config: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub token_program: &'a AccountInfo,
}

impl<'a> TryFrom<&'a [AccountInfo]> for SwapAccounts<'a> {
    type Error = ProgramError;

    fn try_from(accounts: &'a [AccountInfo]) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
    type Error = ProgramError;

    fn try_from(accounts: &'a [AccountInfo]) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        //.. 
    }
}
```
</Codeblock>

<ArticleSection name="Instruction Data" id="instruction-data" level="h2" />

Here's the instruction data we need to pass in:
- `is_x`: If this swap is being performed from token X to token Y or viceversa; needed to line up the accounts correctly. Must be a `[u8]`
- `amount`: The amount of token the user is willing to send in exchange of the other token on the pair. Must be a `[u64]`
- `min`: The mint amount of token that the user is willing to receive in the exchange of the `amount`. Must be a `[u64]`
- `expiration`: The expiration of this order. Important to make sure that the transaction has to be played in a certain amount of time. Must be a `[i64]`

We're going to handle the implementation for the `SwapInstructionData` same as initialization. So I’ll leave the implementation to you:

<Codeblock lang="rust">
```rust
#[repr(C, packed)]
pub struct SwapInstructionData {
    pub is_x: bool,
    pub amount: u64,
    pub min: u64,
    pub expiration: i64,
}

impl<'a> TryFrom<&'a [u8]> for SwapInstructionData {
    type Error = ProgramError;

    fn try_from(data: &'a [u8]) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        //..
    }
}
```
</Codeblock>

> Make sure that any of the amount, like `amount` and `mint` are greater than zero and that the order has not expired yet using the `Clock` sysvar.

<ArticleSection name="Instruction Logic" id="instruction-logic" level="h2" />

We begin by deserializing both the `instruction_data` and the `accounts`.

When then need to:
- Load the `Config` account to grab all the data inside of it. We can do so using the `Config::load()` helper.
- Verify that the `AmmState` is valid (so if it's equal to `AmmState::Initialized`).
- Check the derivation of `vault_x` and `vault_y` to be Associated Token Accounts.
- Deserialize all the token accounts involved and use the data inside of them to calculate the amount to swap using the `constant-product-curve` crate and checking for slippage like this: 
<Codeblock lang="rust">
```rust
// Deserialize the token accounts
let vault_x = unsafe { TokenAccount::from_account_info_unchecked(self.accounts.vault_x)? };
let vault_y = unsafe { TokenAccount::from_account_info_unchecked(self.accounts.vault_y)? };

// Swap Calculations
let mut curve = ConstantProduct::init(
    vault_x.amount(),
    vault_y.amount(),
    vault_x.amount(),
    config.fee,
    None,
)
.map_err(|_| ProgramError::Custom(1))?;

let p = match self.instruction_data.is_x {
    true => LiquidityPair::X,
    false => LiquidityPair::Y,
};

let swap_result = curve
    .swap(p, self.instruction_data.amount, self.instruction_data.min)
    .map_err(|_| ProgramError::Custom(1))?;

// Check for correct values
if swap_result.deposit == 0 || swap_result.withdraw == 0 {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
}
```
</Codeblock>

- Create the transfer logic checking the `is_x` value and transfer the `from` amounts to the vaults and the `to` amounts to the user token accounts like this:

<Codeblock lang="rust">
```rust
if self.instruction_data.is_x {
    Transfer {
        //...
    }
    .invoke()?;

    Transfer {
        //...
    }
    .invoke_signed(&signer_seeds)?;
} else {
    Transfer {
        //...

    }
    .invoke()?;

    Transfer {
        //...
    }
    .invoke_signed(&signer_seeds)?;
}
```
</Codeblock>

You should be proficient enough to this on your own, so I’ll leave the implementation to you:

<Codeblock lang="rust">
```rust
pub struct Swap<'a> {
    pub accounts: SwapAccounts<'a>,
    pub instruction_data: SwapInstructionData,
}

impl<'a> TryFrom<(&'a [u8], &'a [AccountInfo])> for Swap<'a> {
    type Error = ProgramError;

    fn try_from((data, accounts): (&'a [u8], &'a [AccountInfo])) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        let accounts = SwapAccounts::try_from(accounts)?;
        let instruction_data = SwapInstructionData::try_from(data)?;

        // Return the initialized struct
        Ok(Self {
            accounts,
            instruction_data,
        })
    }
}
impl<'a> Swap<'a> {
    pub const DISCRIMINATOR: &'a u8 = &3;

    pub fn process(&mut self) -> ProgramResult {
        //..
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```
