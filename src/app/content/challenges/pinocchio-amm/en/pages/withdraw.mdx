# Withdraw

The `initialize` instruction performs two main tasks:
- Withdraw the `mint_x` and `mint_y` token based on the amount of LP the user want to `burn`.
- Calculate the amount to withdraw and check that the amount isn't less than `mint_x` and `mint_y` designeted by the user.
- Burn the right amount of `mint_lp` from the user ata.

> As mention in the `initialize` instruction section; we're going to initialize all the `Associated Token Accounts` outside of our instruction for optimization purposes.

<ArticleSection name="Required Accounts" id="required-accounts" level="h2" />

Below are the accounts required for this context:
- `user`: The user that is withdrawing the token into the liquidity of the Amm. Must be a `signer`.
- `mint_lp`: The Mint account that will represent the pool’s liquidity. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `vault_x`: The token account that holds all of token X deposited into the pool. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `vault_y`: The token account that holds all of token Y deposited into the pool. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `user_x_ata`: The user's associated token account for token X. This is the destination account from which the user's token X will be transferred into the pool. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `user_y_ata`: The user's associated token account for token Y. This is the destination account from which the user's token Y will be transferred into the pool. Must be passed as `mutable`.
- `config`: The configuration account for the AMM pool. Stores all relevant pool parameters and state.
- `token program`: The SPL Token program account. This is required to perform token operations such as transfers and minting. Must be `executable`.

Here, again, I’ll leave the implementation to you:

<Codeblock lang="rust">
```rust
pub struct WithdrawAccounts<'a> {
    pub user: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub mint_lp: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub vault_x: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub vault_y: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub user_x_ata: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub user_y_ata: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub user_lp_ata: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub config: &'a AccountInfo,
    pub token_program: &'a AccountInfo,
}

impl<'a> TryFrom<&'a [AccountInfo]> for WithdrawAccounts<'a> {
    type Error = ProgramError;

    fn try_from(accounts: &'a [AccountInfo]) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        //.. 
    }
}
```
</Codeblock>

<ArticleSection name="Instruction Data" id="instruction-data" level="h2" />

Here's the instruction data we need to pass in:
- `amount`: The amount of LP token that the user wish to burn. Must be a `[u64]`
- `min_x`: The min amount of token X that the user is willing to withdraw. Must be a `[u64]`
- `min_y`: The mint amount of token Y that the user is willing to withdraw. Must be a `[u64]`
- `expiration`: The expiration of this order. Important to make sure that the transaction has to be played in a certain amount of time. Must be a `[i64]`

We're going to handle the implementation for the `WithdrawInstructionData` same as initialization. So I’ll leave the implementation to you:

<Codeblock lang="rust">
```rust
#[repr(C, packed)]
pub struct WithdrawInstructionData {
    pub amount: u64,
    pub min_x: u64,
    pub min_y: u64,
    pub expiration: i64,
}

impl<'a> TryFrom<&'a [u8]> for WithdrawInstructionData {
    type Error = ProgramError;

    fn try_from(data: &'a [u8]) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        //..
    }
}
```
</Codeblock>

> Make sure that any of the amount, like `amount`, `min_y` and `min_x` are greater than zero and that the order has not expired yet using the `Clock` sysvar.

<ArticleSection name="Instruction Logic" id="instruction-logic" level="h2" />

We begin by deserializing both the `instruction_data` and the `accounts`.

When then need to:
- Load the `Config` account to grab all the data inside of it. We can do so using the `Config::load()` helper.
- Verify that the `AmmState` is valid (so if it's not equal to `AmmState::Disabled`).
- Check the derivation of `vault_x` and `vault_y` to be Associated Token Accounts.
- Deserialize all the token accounts involved and use the data inside of them to calculate the amount to withdraw using the `constant-product-curve` crate and checking for slippage like this: 
<Codeblock lang="rust">
```rust
let mint_lp = unsafe { Mint::from_account_info_unchecked(self.accounts.mint_lp)? };
let vault_x = unsafe { TokenAccount::from_account_info_unchecked(self.accounts.vault_x)? };
let vault_y = unsafe { TokenAccount::from_account_info_unchecked(self.accounts.vault_y)? };

let (x, y) = match mint_lp.supply() == self.instruction_data.amount {
    true => (vault_x.amount(), vault_y.amount()),
    false => {
        let amounts = ConstantProduct::xy_withdraw_amounts_from_l(
            vault_x.amount(),
            vault_y.amount(),
            mint_lp.supply(),
            self.instruction_data.amount,
            6,
        )
        .map_err(|_| ProgramError::InvalidArgument)?;

        (amounts.x, amounts.y)
    }
};

// Check for slippage
if !(x <= self.instruction_data.min_x && y <= self.instruction_data.min_y) {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
}
```
</Codeblock>
- Transfer the amounts from the vaults to the token accounts of the user and burn the appropriate amount of LP tokens in the user token account

> The `authority` of `vault_x` and `vault_y` is the `config` account

You should be proficient enough to this on your own, so I’ll leave the implementation to you:

<Codeblock lang="rust">
```rust
pub struct Withdraw<'a> {
    pub accounts: WithdrawAccounts<'a>,
    pub instruction_data: WithdrawInstructionData,
}

impl<'a> TryFrom<(&'a [u8], &'a [AccountInfo])> for Withdraw<'a> {
    type Error = ProgramError;

    fn try_from((data, accounts): (&'a [u8], &'a [AccountInfo])) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        let accounts = WithdrawAccounts::try_from(accounts)?;
        let instruction_data = WithdrawInstructionData::try_from(data)?;

        // Return the initialized struct
        Ok(Self {
            accounts,
            instruction_data,
        })
    }
}

impl<'a> Withdraw<'a> {
    pub const DISCRIMINATOR: &'a u8 = &2;

    pub fn process(&mut self) -> ProgramResult {
        //..
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```
